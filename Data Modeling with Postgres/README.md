(1). There are 6 files and 1 data folder including two data sets in my repository.
(2). For the two .ipynb files, you can just open and run it in the workspace.
     But for 3 .py files, you have to open a new terminal to execute them by typing "python filename.py".
(3). The steps for this project: 
     * sql_queries.py ---> create_tables.py ----> etl.ipynb----> etl.py ----> test.ipynb
     ---> readme.md
(4). Attention: each time you run create_table.py, you have to restart  etl.ipynb and test.ipynb first to close the connection to   
     database.

Introduction:
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

Project Description:
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

Getting started
python create_tables.py
python etl.py

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Python scripts
create_tables.py: Clean previous schema and creates tables.
sql_queries.py: All queries used in the ETL pipeline.
etl.py: Read JSON logs and JSON metadata and load the data into generated tables.

ETL Pipeline Details
song_data ETL
Source dataset
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{
  "num_songs": 1,
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
  "artist_latitude": null,
  "artist_longitude": null,
  "artist_location": "",
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
  "duration": 152.92036,
  "year": 0
}

log_data ETL
Source dataset
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

{
  "artist": "Pavement",
  "auth": "Logged In",
  "firstName": "Sylvie",
  "gender": "F",

  "lastName": "Cruz",

}

songplays table: Save the timestamp, user ID, level, song ID, artist ID, session ID, location, and user agent from dataset. The song ID and artist ID will be retrieved by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time.
